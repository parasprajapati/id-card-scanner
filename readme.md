# ID Card Scanner

This small application manages barcode ID cards. You can scan cards to keep track of timestamps.

An admin panel exists to edit, add, and delete cards, as well as bring up useful reports.

## Admin Panel

There is a built in admin user to manage the cards and view the reports. This admin user has protected routes so no guest can view it.

### Cards

You can manage the member cards individually. There are import and export functions.

### Reports

This app can generate useful reports based on member or event. You can select a date range for a member or event and see the total time a member was in for the day.

You are able to export the reports as a printable PDF or a CSV spreadsheet.
